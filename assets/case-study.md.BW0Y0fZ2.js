This was not only a repository migration. It was a shift in how the team owns setup, upgrades, onboarding, and releases across projects.</p><p>The result was a simpler developer path, faster shared delivery, and a clearer contract between reusable runtime code and project-specific customization.</p><h2 id="where-we-started" tabindex="-1">Where We Started <a class="header-anchor" href="#where-we-started" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Where We Started&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Before restructuring, shared logic was spread across multiple repositories and copied in different forms across projects. The system worked, but it created predictable friction:</p><ul><li>Similar setup and linting logic had to be maintained in more than one place.</li><li>Shared changes often required cross-repo coordination and multiple pull requests.</li><li>New projects and onboarding paths were not fully consistent.</li><li>Documentation reflected older polyrepo assumptions and occasionally contradicted runtime reality.</li></ul><p>In short, the platform had grown, but the operating model had not kept up.</p><h2 id="the-core-problem-in-human-terms" tabindex="-1">The Core Problem (In Human Terms) <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-core-problem-in-human-terms" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Core Problem (In Human Terms)&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="_1-every-project-felt-slightly-different" tabindex="-1">1) Every Project Felt Slightly Different <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-every-project-felt-slightly-different" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1) Every Project Felt Slightly Different&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Teams could start quickly, but projects drifted over time. Shared setup behavior and project-owned custom logic were not always clearly separated. That increased maintenance cost and made upgrades harder to trust.</p><h3 id="_2-shipping-shared-changes-was-slower-than-it-should-be" tabindex="-1">2) Shipping Shared Changes Was Slower Than It Should Be <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-shipping-shared-changes-was-slower-than-it-should-be" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2) Shipping Shared Changes Was Slower Than It Should Be&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Cross-cutting updates often involved touching multiple repositories and coordinating release timing. Even when the code changes were small, delivery overhead was not.</p><h3 id="_3-onboarding-took-too-much-translation" tabindex="-1">3) Onboarding Took Too Much Translation <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-onboarding-took-too-much-translation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3) Onboarding Took Too Much Translation&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Developers had to mentally map docs, scripts, and repository boundaries before they could make confident changes. The first run experience was not as predictable as it needed to be.</p><h2 id="what-we-considered" tabindex="-1">What We Considered <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-we-considered" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What We Considered&quot;">​</a></h2><p>We evaluated three options:</p><ol><li>Keep polyrepo and standardize scripts incrementally.</li><li>Move everything, including the integration app, into one monorepo.</li><li>Adopt a hybrid model: monorepo for shared packages, separate reference app.</li></ol><p>Option 1 reduced disruption but did not solve coordination overhead enough. Option 2 improved centralization but weakened the role of an independent integration gate. Option 3 gave us the best balance: fast shared development, plus an external safety net for release validation.</p><h2 id="decision-hybrid-model-with-explicit-contracts" tabindex="-1">Decision: Hybrid Model with Explicit Contracts <a class="header-anchor" href="#decision-hybrid-model-with-explicit-contracts" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Decision: Hybrid Model with Explicit Contracts&quot;">​</a></h2><p>We chose a hybrid architecture built around clear ownership boundaries:</p><ul><li><code>webentor-stack</code> is the source of truth for shared packages and docs: <ul><li><code>webentor-core</code></li><li><code>webentor-configs</code></li><li><code>webentor-setup</code></li><li><code>webentor-starter</code></li><li>docs</li></ul></li><li><code>webentor-reference</code> remains external and acts as an integration gate.</li><li><code>webentor-setup</code> is mirrored to support subtree-based consumption in client projects.</li></ul><p>This model was designed around real distribution constraints, not theoretical purity.</p><h2 id="what-changed-in-practice" tabindex="-1">What Changed in Practice <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-changed-in-practice" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What Changed in Practice&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="shared-runtime-became-a-stable-setup-contract" tabindex="-1">Shared Runtime Became a Stable Setup Contract <a class="header-anchor" href="#shared-runtime-became-a-stable-setup-contract" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Shared Runtime Became a Stable Setup Contract&quot;">​</a></h3><p><code>webentor-setup</code> now defines how setup and upgrades should behave across projects. Runtime scripts are consumed into <code>scripts/setup-core/</code> as synchronized payload, while project-specific behavior stays outside shared runtime.</p><p>Project extensions are intentionally limited to:</p><ul><li><code>scripts/.env.setup</code></li><li><code>scripts/hooks/</code></li><li><code>scripts/project-specific/</code></li></ul><p>This boundary prevents project logic from leaking into core runtime and makes upgrades safer.</p><h3 id="upgrade-safety-became-a-first-class-workflow" tabindex="-1">Upgrade Safety Became a First-Class Workflow <a class="header-anchor" href="#upgrade-safety-became-a-first-class-workflow" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Upgrade Safety Became a First-Class Workflow&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Starter upgrades use versioned manifests, dry-run reporting, and protected project-owned paths. Teams can inspect planned changes before applying them, which reduces migration risk and improves confidence.</p><h3 id="documentation-was-treated-as-operating-model-not-afterthought" tabindex="-1">Documentation Was Treated as Operating Model, Not Afterthought <a class="header-anchor" href="#documentation-was-treated-as-operating-model-not-afterthought" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Documentation Was Treated as Operating Model, Not Afterthought&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The onboarding path was consolidated, navigation was simplified, and outdated assumptions were removed. The objective was simple: reduce interpretation work for developers and make the canonical flow obvious.</p><h2 id="rollout-strategy" tabindex="-1">Rollout Strategy <a class="header-anchor" href="#rollout-strategy" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Rollout Strategy&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The migration was executed in phases to minimize disruption:</p><ol><li>Freeze and baseline current repositories.</li><li>Import shared repositories into monorepo package boundaries.</li><li>Keep <code>webentor-reference</code> separate and wire CI integration checks.</li><li>Shift setup consumption toward package-driven runtime contract.</li><li>Migrate existing projects in controlled batches using a runbook.</li><li>Use rollback checkpoints and dry-run-first rules throughout rollout.</li></ol><p>This gave the team a reversible path at every major step.</p><h2 id="before-and-after-architecture" tabindex="-1">Before and After Architecture <a class="header-anchor" href="#before-and-after-architecture" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Before and After Architecture&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="language-mermaid vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">mermaid</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-light:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#E1E4E8;">flowchart LR</span></span>
