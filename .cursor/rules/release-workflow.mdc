# Webentor Release Workflow

Use these steps whenever a request involves releasing, versioning, publishing, or post-release validation.

1. Pre-release checks:
   - Confirm CI is green for the target branch/PR.
   - Confirm a changeset exists in `.changeset/` for package changes.
2. Add/update changeset:
   - Run `pnpm changeset`.
   - Select affected package(s) and semver bump type.
   - Write a short, user-facing summary.
3. PR flow:
   - Open PR and wait for `ci.yml` checks to pass.
   - Merge to `main` only after CI and reviewer approval.
4. Automated versioning/publish:
   - `release.yml` runs on push to `main`.
   - Changesets action opens/updates the "Version Packages" PR.
   - Merging that PR updates package versions/changelogs and publishes to npm.
5. Post-release automation:
   - `demo-bump.yml` runs after release success and calls `scripts/bump-demo.sh`.
   - This is currently a placeholder handoff for downstream integration.
6. Mirror flow:
   - Push a `v*` tag to trigger `split-webentor-setup.yml` and `split-webentor-starter.yml`.
   - Mirrors use `git subtree split` to publish package contents to standalone repos.
7. Validation:
   - Verify published versions for `webentor-core` and `webentor-configs` on npm.
   - Verify mirror repos received updates for `webentor-setup` and `webentor-starter`.

## Guardrails

- Only `webentor-core` and `webentor-configs` are npm-published via Changesets.
- `webentor-setup` and `webentor-starter` are delivered via split-mirror workflows.
- Changesets baseline config is `.changeset/config.json` (`baseBranch: main`, `access: public`).
- Required GitHub secrets for demo bump workflow: `WEBENTOR_DEMO_REPO`, `WEBENTOR_DEMO_TOKEN`.
